## Description

**Hiredge AI** is an AI-powered resume analysis tool built with Django and Python. It uses the OpenAI API to analyze uploaded resumes and provide actionable, personalized feedback to improve them. The goal is to assist job seekers in refining their resumes for better job search outcomes.

This project was created out of a genuine need to help individuals struggling with resume clarity, structure, or impact. With job markets becoming increasingly competitive, having a tool that automates resume enhancement can make a real difference in landing interviews.

Hiredge AI was planned from the beginning to be both useful and easy to useâ€”providing feedback within seconds after uploading a resume.
